client code uses a SyncedGraph, which has a few things:

AutoDepGraphApi - knockoutjs-inspired API for querying the graph in a
way that lets me call you again when there were changes to the things
you queried

CurrentStateGraphApi - a way to query the graph that doesn't gather
your dependencies like AutoDepGraphApi does

GraphEditApi - methods to write patches to the graph for common
operations, e.g. replacing a value, or editing a mapping

PatchReceiver - our web server that listens to edits from the master graph

PatchSender - collects and transmits your graph edits
